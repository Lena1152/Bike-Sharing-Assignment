Problem Statement:
BoomBikes, a U.S.-based bike-sharing provider, has experienced a significant decline in revenues due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The company is facing challenges in sustaining its business during this period. However, as the economy begins to recover, BoomBikes is looking for ways to capitalize on the post-pandemic demand for shared bikes. To prepare for this rebound, the company seeks to understand the factors influencing bike demand in order to develop an effective business strategy that aligns with customer needs and market trends.

Objective:
The goal is to create a multiple linear regression model that predicts bike demand based on factors such as weather and user behavior. This model will help BoomBikes:

Identify the key variables affecting bike demand.
Assess how well these factors predict demand.
Inform business strategies for post-pandemic recovery.
The insights will guide BoomBikes in adjusting their services to meet customer needs and optimize their operations in a recovering market.
